## Usage

After you've installed the project, you'll need to run two separate servers to get the Unnamed Blog API up and running:

1.  Run the `server.js` file to start the backend server:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `node server.js`

    `node index.js` 
    

Now, you can access the Unnamed Blog API by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`. You'll be able to create, read, update, and delete blog content through the user interface.
